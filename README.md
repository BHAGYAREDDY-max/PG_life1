Project:PG Life Accommodation finder.

Welcome to PG Life – Accommodation Finder, a smart and user-friendly web application designed to help students and working professionals find suitable Paying Guest accommodations easily. This system provides complete information about available PG rooms, including rent details, facilities, location, and images. The website is fully functional and structured with both frontend and backend technologies. It can be executed on a local system or deployed on a web server for real-time usage.

Step 1: Project Overview and Environment Setup

Before running the project, make sure your system is properly configured. Install Node.js to manage server-side operations and MongoDB to handle the database. This project follows a client-server architecture where the frontend handles user interaction and the backend manages data processing and database communication. Proper installation of required software ensures smooth execution without errors.

Step 2: System Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

Frontend: Responsible for user interface, design, and interaction.

Backend: Handles server logic, API requests, authentication, and database connection.

The frontend sends requests to the backend, and the backend fetches or stores data in MongoDB. This structured flow ensures organized data management and better performance.

Step 3: Database Configuration

MongoDB is used as the primary database system to store user details, PG listings, pricing information, and facility data. Create a database locally and configure the connection string in the backend configuration file. Proper database setup is important for storing and retrieving data correctly.
